# PersonaEval Playbook (v2.0)
Purpose: generate realistic scenarios + test seeds without domain contamination.

## Inputs that produce strong results
- 2–5 line idea + target stakeholders
- success definition (what must be true)
- constraints (data sensitivity, ops, integrations)

## How to use outputs
- Treat “Scenario Backlog” as discovery fuel.
- Treat “Test Seeds Pack” as raw material for BA’s AC/TA.
- Paste the “Handoff Envelope” into Solution Designer unchanged.

## Anti-patterns
- Asking PersonaEval to design architecture.
- Letting it invent features outside in-scope boundaries.
- Accepting vague “best practices” without scenarios + test seeds.
