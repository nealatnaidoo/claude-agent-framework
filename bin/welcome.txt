  CLAUDE AGENT FRAMEWORK — Installed Successfully
============================================================================

  What is it?
  -----------
  A governance layer for Claude Code that replaces one big AI conversation
  with a team of specialized agents, each with strict permissions. Instead
  of hoping the AI does the right thing, hooks mechanically enforce it —
  coding can't start without a spec, deployments need ops approval, and
  every change is traceable.

  How it works
  ------------
  You describe what you want, and the framework routes it through agents:

    You: "I want to build a task manager app"
                      |
                init agent         scaffolds project, registers in portfolio
                      |
               persona agent       defines user journeys
                      |
               design agent        bounded solution (consults ops)
                      |
                 ba agent          writes spec, tasklist, quality rules
                      |
           back + front agents     implement code (only from the spec)
                      |
                qa agent           governance check after each task
                      |
               review agent        deep verification after feature

  For small fixes, a fast-track path skips the ceremony: coding -> QA -> done.

  What makes it different?
  ------------------------
  Exclusive permissions    Backend agent cannot write frontend code, and
                           vice versa. Ops is the only one that can deploy.
                           Hooks block the action if the wrong agent tries.

  Mechanical enforcement   9 hooks fire on tool use and agent startup.
                           They check: Does a spec exist? Is the phase
                           correct? Is this agent allowed to do this?

  Portfolio dashboards     caf cockpit portfolio generates an HTML dashboard
                           across all your governed projects.

  Manifest checkpoint      Every project has .claude/manifest.yaml tracking
                           phase, tasks, artifacts, and remediation. Agents
                           read it first on restart and pick up where they
                           left off.

  What you get out of the box
  ---------------------------
  12 specialized agents     Each with defined scope and permissions
  9 governance hooks        Block unauthorized actions mechanically
  CLI tooling (caf)         Status, drift detection, validation, dashboards
  Portfolio cockpit         HTML dashboard aggregating all projects
  Drift detection           Verify decisions are reflected in code
  Batch processing          Run parallel headless agent jobs
  Lesson system             117+ development lessons indexed by topic
  Snapshot/rollback         Point-in-time recovery for the framework

  Your first 5 minutes
  --------------------
  1. Set your API key (see below) and open Claude Code in any directory.
     A status screen appears automatically.

  2. Say "Initialize this project for governance" — the init agent
     creates the .claude/ folder and registers the project.

  3. Say "Start with personas" — the persona agent defines user journeys.
     Then design, BA, and coding agents take over in sequence.

  4. After each task, QA runs a 5-minute check. After a full feature,
     the review agent does a 60-minute deep verification.

  5. Run  caf cockpit portfolio  to see all your projects at a glance.
